# Aero Challenge

Built in a simple Vite setup. To run it you just need to:

- ```npm install```
- Either ```npm run dev``` or ```npm run build```
- If you do the build process you will need to upload the compiled files to somewhere that runs a http server and is being served from a root directory. Because the links to the assets are from /assets/ not ../assets/
